  midlands in KwaZulu-Natal. I Attend Howick high school in a small town called Howick. Where I matriculated.
  Once matriculated i worked in a hotel in Carlow town in Ireland. After 4 years I returned to South Africa to persue a carrer in architectural draughting.
  I have been working as a draughtsman for 15 years (as of 2023). I am a proud father to 2 daughters Kasey(12) and Seanna(5). Who are my whole world.
  I started to learn web development and python programming in 2023 to pursue a carrer as a programmer or developer.

<p>I am a very keen rugby supporter (the Springboks of course) I also support the provinicial team The Sharks. I am a very dedicated
  F1 fan. I have followed F1 for many years and have always been a Farrari fan. I still believe Michael Schumacher is the greatest F1 driver ever.
